An e-commerce website allows people to buy and sell
physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet
rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce
website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage
shipping and logistics, and providing customer service.
     
An e-commerce website is a digital storefront allowing buyers to
shop for goods and sell products and services. It's a
virtual space where customers can make selections and sellers can
showcase products.

It only has a frontend and does not include a backend.
